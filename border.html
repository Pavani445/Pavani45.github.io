More Picture Border Fun With HTML
June 9, 2012 7 Comments

If you missed this intro to HTML borders, you’ll need to go back and understand the basics so that this post will make more sense.

So now, I want to take this one step further and build just a little bit more on what I’ve already shown you.  Let’s start by adding a “padding”.

HOW TO ADD PADDING 

padding: 20px


To add a border to a photo, simply use this code

10px – You can change this to any width you want.
solid – This creates a solid border, but you can also choose from dotted, dashed, and double. – This is the hexadecimal code for black,
ADD A DIFFERENT BORDER TO EACH SIDE OF THE PHOTO:
If you’d like to add a different style of border to each side of the photo, simply define the side. Instead of simply using “border”, use these:
Of course, you can change up the width of the borders, the styles, and the colors any way you like.</p>

	 <p>*Table Element
	The table element allows you to arrange and present data in rows and columns of cells. However, it can’t do much without its supporting cast: the tr (table row), td (table data cell), and th (table header) elements. So, let’s start out by using these basic elements with some common attributes.</p>

	<div style="border-style:groove; border-width:3px ; border-color:blue;">
	 <p>*Table Headings
The th element holds the heading of each column. Let’s say you’re developing a reading list of your favorite books and you want columns for the authors, for the book titles, and for indicating if you’ve read each book.</p>

	 <p>*Table Rows
The tr element defines the rows of your table. While the three th elements already display as a “row,” the tr element gives structure and meaning to a row—and a table can have lots of rows.</p>
